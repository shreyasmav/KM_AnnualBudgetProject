## Overview
The project basically aims at democratizing the economic system of a country.This is done by allowing the citizens of the country to  express their aspirations and fill in their choices for the annual financial budget sector-wise.This is done through a website wherein citizens can login and fill in their choices(tacit knowledge).We have basically considered 4 major ectors which are Agriculture , Defence , Education , Health. The citizens fill in their choices and their responses are recorded in the backend database.The website also intends to make the citizen(user) more informed before filling in his choice , this is done through including the analysis of the previous year's financial budget. Additionally the user before filling in his choice is also made aware of the possible consequences that might happen for choosing a particular option. Finally the data is processed and analysed by using buisness intelligence tools like POWER-BI and is sent to the government experts before formulating the annual budget.
